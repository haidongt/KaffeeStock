If you have an existing schema, you will need to run the following command (see below for information on how to install liquibase and create defaults.properties file)

$ liquibase --changeLogFile=db.changelog-initial.xml changelogSync

Example:
$ cd src/main/resources/db/
$ liquibase --changeLogFile=db.changelog-initial.xml changelogSync
Liquibase Home is not set.
Liquibase Home: /Users/vlad/dev/liquibase-2.0.5-bin
INFO 3/12/13 3:55 PM:liquibase: Successfully acquired change log lock
INFO 3/12/13 3:55 PM:liquibase: Reading from `DATABASECHANGELOG`
INFO 3/12/13 3:55 PM:liquibase: Reading from `DATABASECHANGELOG`
INFO 3/12/13 3:55 PM:liquibase: Successfully released change log lock
Liquibase 'changelogSync' Successful
$
Now you can start the server.

How to install Liquibase on your machine

1. Download and install liquibase binaries.
Download link: http://www.liquibase.org/download
In my example I extracted it to /Users/vlad/dev/liquibase-2.0.5-bin.

2. Add liquibase CLI to your path:
$ vi ~/.profile
$ export PATH=$PATH:/Users/vlad/dev/liquibase-2.0.5-bin;
$ source ~/.profile

This is it, you are now ready to work with liquibase.
